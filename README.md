# Image Format

- **`PNG`** - better image quality but larger file size. Best suited for cropping and capturing simple web pages
- **`JPG`** - smaller file size but a bit worse image quality. Useful when taking fullscreen screenshots of images and videos


# Screenshot Size

- **`Preserver original DPI size`** - the screenshot will be saved with the actual page size that you are seeing on screen

- **`Adjust to actual size`** - on HDPI displays like Retina or zoomed in pages, the screenshot will be downscaled to the original page size
